      <p>Today, more than half of our students are living and studying outside Afghanistan, hosted at the American University of Iraq Sulaimani in Kurdistan, the American University of Central Asia in Bishkek, and Bard College in the United States, or living independently and studying online from across the globe. Yet we remain acutely aware of the dangers and challenges faced daily by those students, faculty, staff, and alumni who remain in Afghanistan. We are working without pause to bring all to safety. </p>
 
<p>The coming year will see the establishment of AUAF’s new branch campus in Doha; the launch of an ambitious new institute for Afghanistan research and teaching, located at the campus of the Venice International University on the Island of San Servolo; and an expansion of online programs to reach students inside Afghanistan’s borders and around the world.</p>    </div>
